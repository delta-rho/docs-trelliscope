When the user has generated or opened a new display of visualization panels using Trelliscope in their browser a list of one or more displays will appear. Once the user selects a display from the list, a plot will be shown in the viewer. 

**Example:**
Here you can see two related displays have been created from the dataset.  The first display will show power over time by date.  The second display will show power versus temperature by date.
